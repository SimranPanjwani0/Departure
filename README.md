# Kabir ke Dohe Page (Flutter)

##### The "Kabir ke Dohe" page is an essential part of the application where users can explore the <br> profound teachings of the poet-saint Kabirdas Ji through his famous dohas (couplets). <br> This page dynamically fetches data from a JSON file, making it easy to manage and display multiple dohas.


## Key Features:


#### Dynamic Content: The dohas are stored in a JSON format, allowing for easy updates and scalability. Each doha, along with its corresponding details like meaning and explanation, is fetched from this JSON data.

#### List of Dohas: Users can view a list of multiple dohas on this page. Each item in the list provides a brief view of the doha, and clicking on a doha leads to the detailed view page.

#### Smooth Navigation: Upon selecting a doha, users are navigated to a detailed page where they can read the entire doha, its meaning, and translation options.

#### Translation Options: On the detailed page, users can translate the doha into different languages like English, Hindi, or Gujarati for better understanding.

#### State Management: The app uses the provider package to manage state, ensuring efficient loading and interaction between the JSON data and UI components.

#### UI and Layout: The UI is designed to keep the focus on simplicity and readability, making the dohas accessible and easy to navigate.

## Packages Used

- **provider**: For state management.
- **share_plus**: To enable sharing dohas as text with other applications.
